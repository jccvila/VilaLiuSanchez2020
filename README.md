# VilaLiuSanchez2020

This repository contain the datafiles and code used to generate the figures in VilaSanchezLiu2020. 

Input data from the emergent simplicity paper can be found in Data/emergent_dada2processed.zip.
Doc analysis and corresponding statistics can be generated using scripts in Data_Processing_Scripts.
All figures can be generated by running code in figure generating scripts.

Data processing Scripts

Dada_Processing.R - Extract data from DADA2 output and rarefies to constant read depths. Formats Data for subsequent analysis.
DOC.R - Performs DOC analysis on Equilibrium data (with 500 bootstrap realizations)
Bootstrap_Curve_Fitting.R - Performs LOWESS and LM Fitting on all 500 bootstrap realizations (gateing by the different criteria used). 
Bootstrap_Curve_Fitting_Citrobacter.R - Performs LOWESS and LM Fitting to all 500 bootstrap realizations gating by presence/absence of citrobacter.
Bootstrap_Tests.R - Performs T-tests on all 500 bootstrap realizations for all the pairwise comparisons analyzed in the paper.
